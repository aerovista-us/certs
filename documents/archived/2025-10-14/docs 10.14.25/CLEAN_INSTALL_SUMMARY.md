## 🎯 The Clean Install Approach

### Old Way (Broken)
```
┌─────────────┐
│  Services   │ ← Published ports directly to host
│ (port mess) │ ← Port conflicts (8080, 9443, 5678)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
   Tailscale Serve ← Ad-hoc routing, timeouts
       │
    Tailnet
```

**Problems:**
- Port conflicts everywhere
- Services not on same network
- Traefik couldn't route
- Constant password prompts
- Certificate confusion

### New Way (Clean)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Traefik :80/:443           │ ← Single entry point
│      (with Tailscale certs)         │ ← Proper TLS
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │ gateway network
    ┌────────┼────────┬────────┐
    │        │        │        │
  ┌─┴─┐   ┌─┴──┐  ┌──┴──┐  ┌──┴────┐
  │n8n│   │File│  │Port │  │Traefik│
  │   │   │Brow│  │ainer│  │  UI   │
  └───┘   └────┘  └─────┘  └───────┘
    ↑        ↑       ↑         ↑
  no ports  no     no        no
published  ports  ports     ports
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No port conflicts (only 80, 443, 4443)
- ✅ All services on gateway network
- ✅ Traefik routes everything
- ✅ SSH keys = no passwords
- ✅ One cert for all

## 📋 Deployment Order (Critical)

**MUST follow this order:**

1. **SSH Keys** ← Eliminates password hell
2. **Tailscale Certs** ← One cert, many uses
3. **Traefik** ← Creates gateway network, owns ports
4. **n8n** ← First service behind Traefik
5. **FileBrowser** ← Second service
6. **Portainer** ← Admin within 5 min!
7. **AeroCaller** ← Special: direct HTTPS
8. **Auxiliary** ← Watchtower, metrics, TURN

## 🚀 How to Execute Clean Install

### Step 1: Wipe Current State (Optional)
```bash
# SSH to NXCore
ssh glyph@192.168.7.209

# Run wipe script
bash <(cat /path/to/clean-wipe-nxcore.sh)
# OR manually:
sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -aq)
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)
sudo docker network rm gateway
```

### Step 2: Follow the Guide
```powershell
# From Windows, open:
# docs/CLEAN_INSTALL_GUIDE.md

# Then execute Phase 1 (SSH keys)
# ... Phase 2 (Certs)
# ... Phase 3 (Traefik)
# ... etc.
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything
```bash
# On NXCore:
sudo docker ps
sudo docker network inspect gateway
curl -I https://n8n.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/
curl -I https://files.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/
curl -I https://portainer.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/
```

## 🔑 Key Learnings from 200 Pages

### Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid

1. **❌ Deploying services before Traefik**
   - Causes: Port conflicts, wrong networks
   - Fix: Traefik MUST be first

2. **❌ Publishing ports for proxied services**
   - Causes: Port conflicts, bypasses Traefik
   - Fix: Remove `ports:` from compose files

3. **❌ Not using external network**
   - Causes: "Network exists but not created by compose"
   - Fix: `external: true` in all compose files

4. **❌ No SSH keys**
   - Causes: 50+ password prompts per deployment
   - Fix: Set up keys once, use forever

5. **❌ Not minting certs first**
   - Causes: TLS errors, manual cert copying
   - Fix: Mint Tailscale cert before Traefik

6. **❌ Forgetting Portainer timeout**
   - Causes: 5-min lockout loop
   - Fix: Create admin immediately after deploy

7. **❌ Using Tailscale Serve with HTTP/2**
   - Causes: WebSocket failures (AeroCaller)
   - Fix: Node-terminated TLS for WebSocket apps

8. **❌ Not checking if on gateway network**
   - Causes: Traefik can't find service IPs
   - Fix: `docker inspect <svc> | grep gateway`

9. **❌ Mixing Tailscale Serve + Traefik**
   - Causes: Confusion, double proxying
   - Fix: Pick ONE routing layer per service

10. **❌ No healthcheck or wrong healthcheck**
    - Causes: Container shows "unhealthy"
    - Fix: Use `wget` (Alpine) or install `curl`

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Password prompts** | 50+ per deploy | 0 (SSH keys) |
| **Port conflicts** | 3+ major | 0 |
| **Routing failures** | n8n, Portainer | None |
| **TLS errors** | AeroCaller WS | None |
| **Deploy time** | Hours (debugging) | ~30 min |
| **Services proxied** | 0 (all direct) | 4 via Traefik |
| **Network misconfigs** | gateway issues | Clean |
| **Docker networks** | 4+ fragmented | 1 (gateway) |

## 🎓 What This Teaches Us

### Architecture Principles

1. **Gateway First**
   - Always deploy reverse proxy before applications
   - Let it own the shared network
   - All apps join that network

2. **Secrets Once**
   - Generate SSH keys once
   - Mint certs once
   - Mount everywhere

3. **No Ports = No Conflicts**
   - Apps behind proxy: no published ports
   - Only proxy publishes 80/443
   - Special cases (AeroCaller): different port range

4. **External Networks**
   - Shared networks must be `external: true`
   - Let first service (Traefik) create it
   - Others join as external

5. **Automation Needs Auth**
   - SSH keys enable scriptable deployment
   - Passwordless sudo for Docker commands
   - No interactive prompts = reliable automation

## 📞 Support

If you hit issues during clean install:

1. **Check the troubleshooting guide:**
   `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_COMPLETE_REPORT.md`

2. **Verify each phase:**
   Each section in `CLEAN_INSTALL_GUIDE.md` has a ✅ checkpoint

3. **Common fixes:**
   - Reset: `sudo docker restart <service>`
   - Check network: `docker inspect <service>`
   - Check Traefik: `docker logs traefik`
   - Clear browser cache for Portainer timeout

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- [ ] SSH to NXCore requires NO password
- [ ] `sudo docker ps` shows NO port conflicts
- [ ] `docker network inspect gateway` shows 4+ containers
- [ ] https://n8n.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/ loads
- [ ] https://files.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/ loads
- [ ] https://portainer.nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net/ loads (with admin created)
- [ ] https://nxcore.tail79107c.ts.net:4443/ loads (AeroCaller)
- [ ] No "unhealthy" containers in `docker ps`

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is prepared for a clean, successful deployment:
- ✅ Complete step-by-step guide
- ✅ All compose files updated
- ✅ Proper architecture documented
- ✅ Troubleshooting reference
- ✅ Wipe script for fresh start

**Time estimate:** 30 minutes for full clean install  
**Difficulty:** Easy (just follow the guide)  
**Risk:** Low (wipe script is safe, no data loss if you skip volume removal)
