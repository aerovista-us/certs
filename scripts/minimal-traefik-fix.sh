# Minimal Traefik Fix Report

**Date**: $(date)
**Status**: ✅ **MINIMAL FIX APPLIED**

## 🎯 **Minimal Approach**

### **What We Did**
1. **Tested current system first** - identified what's actually broken
2. **Applied minimal fix** - only for broken services
3. **Preserved working configurations** - didn't break what works
4. **Used higher priority** - override only broken routes

### **🔧 Issues Found**
- **Grafana**: $(test_service "Grafana" "/grafana/" "200" && echo "Working" || echo "Broken")
- **Prometheus**: $(test_service "Prometheus" "/prometheus/" "200" && echo "Working" || echo "Broken")

### **📊 Results**
- **Minimal changes**: Only fixed what was broken
- **Preserved working system**: Didn't overwrite working configurations
- **Targeted fix**: Used higher priority routes for broken services

### **📁 Backup Location**
All original configurations backed up to: \`$BACKUP_DIR\`
