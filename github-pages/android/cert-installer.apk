# NXCore Android Certificate Installer APK
# This is a placeholder file for the Android APK installer
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper Android APK file

# The APK would contain:
# - Certificate installation logic
# - User interface for certificate management
# - Automatic certificate installation
# - Verification and testing tools

# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors
# The actual APK would be generated by the certificate generation scripts
