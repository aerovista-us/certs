# Android Certificate Installation

## APK Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the `cert-installer.apk` file
2. Enable "Install from unknown sources" in your Android settings
3. Tap the downloaded APK file to install
4. Follow the installation wizard
5. Grant necessary permissions when requested

## Manual Installation

If the APK installer doesn't work, you can install certificates manually:

1. Download the certificate files
2. Go to Settings > Security > Install certificates
3. Select the certificate file
4. Enter a name for the certificate
5. Complete the installation

## Troubleshooting

- **Installation blocked**: Enable "Install from unknown sources"
- **Permission denied**: Grant storage and security permissions
- **Certificate not trusted**: Install the root CA certificate first
