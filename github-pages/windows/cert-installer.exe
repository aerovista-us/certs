# NXCore Windows Certificate Installer EXE
# This is a placeholder file for the Windows EXE installer
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper Windows EXE file

# The EXE would contain:
# - Certificate installation logic
# - User interface for certificate management
# - Automatic certificate installation
# - Verification and testing tools
# - PowerShell integration

# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors
# The actual EXE would be generated by the certificate generation scripts
